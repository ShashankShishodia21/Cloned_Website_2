        <h1>What Is The Future of Cinema?</h1>
        <p>Now let's get to the brass taxes, the whole reason you are here is to find out WHAT The Future of Cinema coin or
             The FOC can and will do for you.
            At its core it is your normal run-of-the-mill, everyday crypto currency, no shiny flashing lights or fancy gimmicks
            because the intention of the coin is to be a successful currency. And with that success I am able to fund films and
            plan on doing so for the next 10 years. This coin does not allow anyone on person, entity or company to own more than
            0.5% and no pre-sale big investors, all of this is to stop the intentional fluctuation of the value by selling or buying.
            This will not get rushed to the trade apps until it is ready and ultimately the goal is to build a giant group of supporters
            that it feels like a community and make them wealthy. Why not? Just because they cater to the rich who get richer doens't mean
            that the every day crypto enthusiast can't be a part of an ICO, it just means that everyone is used to the script that the
            wealthy get wealthier and you have to deal with it. When we get to the point where I can fund films, the royalties from those
            films will go right back into the currency, increasing the value without the buying and selling of a market. Really what this
            does is tether the films to the currency and this is a major way we avert instability. And we won't be like any other crypto
            that's core relationship is only to the dollar or other coins. This will greatly reduce volatility by and create a much more 
            stable environment and overall make this a quality investment. It's not even necessary for the currency to go to a very high 
            value to be very successful. I'm talking under a dollar, if it hits a dollar we can fund nearly 4000 movies in 10 years, create 
            hundreds of thousands of new jobs and bask in the Scrooge McDuck pool vault we've collected. And this can be in concert with 
            movie studios or on top of the movies that they make. Both ways creates so many great things I can hardly wait.</p>
            <p>Another intention of The FOC coin is the way it's been designed to be able to add modular applications or business's 
            onto the currency that work in unison with the content, but are different companies at their core. And that means anyone 
            can add new business onto the ecosystem with or without my asking permission.</p>
            <p>The first modular business has already been integrated into the opening of the currency as it will be what allows YOU 
            the ability to fund films. If you want to know more go to the section headings as you'll find the next 3 years have been 
            planned out step by step. And if you'd like to see how I plan to combat transparency well, go to transparency. Also take 
            that picture down and put the picture of me standing on the desk</p>

    <section class="section3" id="about">
            <h1>About the creator</h1>
        
            <p>I have been an independent Filmmaker, Director, and Editor for 22 years I have known I wanted to make movies since I 
                was 2 years old, when I learned how to operate a VCR by myself and since then I have worked tirelessly to accomplis 
                success in this industry. That is until the day that i had the idea for this coin. And at that moment I turned and 
                walked in a new direction in life, I can see how great this is going to be and I only see it being able to be completed 
                if I am there to help crypto and film combine together to make something amazing together. You might not be able to see 
                my vision yet, and that's ok, but I know these are two industries that are meant to be together and it just hasn't been 
                done yet. I am a very imaginative person and with me at the helm, I will bring this entire new world to life. We all have
                a common goal: to make some money and make fantastic films! Welcome to the future!
            </p>

    <section class="section2 bottom" id="term">
        <h1>Terminology</h1>
            <p>
               Do you feel a bit lost with all these acronyms? Yeah well that's because they've all been created very recently 
               and yes, they are ™ and soon to be ®. Let's start with
            </p>
        <h3>FOC - The Future of Cinema</h3>
            <p>
                Which is just the abbreviation for The Future of Cinema Coin. Also it looks like film strip if you draw 
                it in a boxy way. Easy next!
            </p>
        <h3>EVV™ - Evolving Virtual Volume</h3>
            <p>
                This is where you will be able to store all your films you've collected, and hopefully you'll also be able to 
                decorate your EVV with art or maybe you imported a room in a show you like or you designed the structure of the 
                EVV yourself. This space can be a simple list or a 3D batcave you made in a VR art program. You'll be able to do 
                just about anything you want, but at its core it will just be a list of your content as if you had a video library 
                you could flip through. The evv's can be traded or sold or given for free. You can create a store inside your EVV 
                and sell your own digital art, and it might even connect with the metaverse or something like that.
            </p>
        <h3>ENFT's ™ or (Evolving Non Fungible Token)</h3>
            <p>
                Originally that is what the ENFAST's were called ENFT's ™ but because the trademark team just couldnt' seem to wrap 
                their head around the fact that they were NOT nfts I moved on to ENFASTs, although I still own the copyright for ENFT. 
                ENFAST ™ (or Evolving non fungible artistic space, token)
            </p>
        <h3>ENFAST ™ (or Evolving non fungible artistic space, token)</h3>
            <p>
                This is what the films and all of the extra media will be delivered to you in. At first it will look like whatever the 
                production has chosen to be their artistic representation of the film. You can change that or leave it or add onto it. 
                The ENFASTs ™ is basically the next level of the ENFT. They hold the film and all of the goodies that the creative team 
                has made for just the holders of the ENFASTs™. The new content created specifically for the ENFAST™ holders will be stuff 
                like the concept art and concept poster for the film, and and all art design or drawings of costume design, ,set decoration, 
                behind the scenes, interviews with the cast and crew and of course, at the end you'll get the directors cut of the film or a 
                cut that's different than what's released in theaters. And in addition to all of that, you will also participate in the royalties 
                that the creative team has decided to share with their supporters. Each contract will be different and be up to the creative team 
                ultimately to decide upon. I will suggest both a minimum of content and contribution that they should be providing.
            </p>
        <h3>MARQUEE</h3>
            <p>The first modular addition in both phone application and web site which is currently being created to run directly on The FOC.</p>
            <p>
                Marquee will allow everyone with access to a phone or computer the ability to fund films themselves, Trade them and or sell you EVV. 
                Imagine Marquee as the television that allows you to watch all your content. Marquee will also have a trading function where you can 
                sell the ENFASTs ™ or ENFTs™ to another who wants to buy it and its at your discretion of the price you'd like to sell it at. You are 
                also able to put any of the films up for rental to other Marquee users and when the film is rented you cannot watch it but the person 
                who paid can, and you will make a % of that rental fee. If something becomes a cult classic for a generation 50 years from now and everyone 
                wants to rent it or watch it, well, that movie could go back to the theaters and have a brand new run for a completely new generation and 
                all sales go back to the creative team and all traffic will be tracked and this creates a brand new revenue stream for filmmakers and those 
                that supported them early on. Cause if you still ownt hat ENFAST, well you're in for another round of royalties too. With multiple new revenue 
                streams this completelyconcretes the stability within the currency and will continue to raise the value of everything by leaps and bounds.
            </p>
        <h3>NEXT GEN FOC SITE</h3>
            <p>
                Version 2.0 of the FOC web site where you will be able to find a production team to work with or a script to back or an actor to support. 
                This site will be the beginning of where the connections take place. You will also be able to create an EVV and start building or preparing 
                it in anticipation of the MARQUEE app release.
